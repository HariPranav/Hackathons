<p>What is a Hackathon ??</p>
<p>A hackathon is an event in which a team of open minded creative people come together and try to solve a real world problem . A "Team" can consist of a mix of non-technical people , designers , thinkers, artists , developers who are diverse in their age as well as skillsets some of them may be  in their 7th grade and some of them may have a  Phd.</p>
<p>These  events  usually spans for 24 , 48 hours  and they are usually conducted on the weekends .</p>
<p>In this limited time the problem statement is given on spot  and sometimes the team formation is done in the event itself .</p>
<h1 id="why-should-you-attend-a-hackathon">Why Should You Attend a Hackathon ??</h1>
<p>To put into perspective imagine that you are attending your first "HACK"  and you get paired up with a team of people who you have never met before , you are not familiar with each others skills ,strengths and weaknesses, How will you manage to come with a solution to a given problem within the time limit specified ??</p>
<p>Sounds challenging right , Don't worry these events will help you develop some of the core skills needed in the industry such as</p>
<ol>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Leadership</li>
<li>Critical Thinking</li>
<li>Teamwork</li>
<li>Coordination</li>
<li>Deal with conflicts</li>
<li>Crisis Management</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="GOT" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/XYrHWGJPtaQMM/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>to name a few all in the course of a night or two !!!</p>
<p>We can also refer to it as a crash course on becoming a "CREATOR" or an "Entrepreneur" or  a "MAKER" !!.</p>
<p>Sounds Wicked Right ??</p>
<p>Apart from this many of the attendees come to hackathons to "Network" . Networking is considered a very effective way of marketing a company , it also helps to recruit new talent and also meet new creative people with whom you may form a lifelong journey of building products.
The  amazing part of a hackathon is that you can find people who have the same "Vibe" and way of thinking as you do.
Plus if you are  a student you get free attendance, Free merch ,Free Swag and tons of confidence and knowledge that you can take away from the event .
What's there to lose ????</p>
<p>Register For one immediately !!!!</p>
<h2 id="types-of-hackathons">Types of Hackathons :</h2>
<h3 id="internal-hackathons">Internal Hackathons :</h3>
<p>These are usually within the companies and they encourage the employees to collaborate with each other.</p>
<h3 id="external-hackathons">External Hackathons :</h3>
<p>This is the one to look out for especially for students and people looking out for jobs ,
Companies are changing their hiring strategy by putting up challenges for potential employees and students to take part in .</p>
<p>The Main reason is that the companies want to test the potential employees capability in solving a problem in a limited period of time with limited knowledge and resources , this model of employment also greatly reduces the burden on the company as they don't have to allocate extra budget for training and recruitment of their employees .</p>
<p>In today's world of startup's it is crucial to adapt to changes by doing code sprints which last all night long!
What better to experience this culture of the "Startup Culture" .</p>
<h3 id="online-and-offline-hackathons">Online and Offline Hackathons:</h3>
<p>They can be online in the various online platforms such as HackerEarh , MLH ..</p>
<p>Personally I really enjoy attending the offline hackathons as they are mostly held in beautiful venues like Co-Working spaces and huge office campuses such as Microsoft and Google .</p>
<p>The entire space is given towards the event in which  you can experience the culture , the delicious food ,this opens up a new level of work culture , many venues have game centers with games like pool and table tennis , dedicated gyms and a great cafeteria .</p>
<h1 id="tools-for-a-hack">Tools For a Hack</h1>
<h3 id="github">Github :</h3>
<p>What is github ?? in simple terms imagine that multiple people are working on a project with new ideas and updates , How do you ensure that two people have not done the same work twice , or how do you assure that the version of the code is the latest one free of bugs ,
Introducing Version Control , Github helps teams to manage the entire process of writing and deploying code .
The best part is Github offers their student pack which gives students with a valid ID free goodies/tools worth 200k $</p>
<p>Get yours here</p>
<p><a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Github student pack</a></p>
<h3 id="discord-free-voice-chat-for-gamers">Discord (Free Voice chat for Gamers)</h3>
<p>What good is a hackathon without collaboration and communication ??</p>
<p>Discord is one of the most versatile tools that can be used in a hack ,</p>
<p>you can create private servers
create voice channels
Bots</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a></p>
<h3 id="google-suiteslidesdocstaskskeep">Google Suite(Slides,Docs,Tasks,Keep)</h3>
<p>The entire GSuite is a blessing to have in a hack , The true value of real time collaboration can only be appreciated when there are only 15 minutes to submit the solution to a hack !!! XD .</p>
<p>These tools are a life saver , when most of the participants have different operating systems with different word processors and applications.</p>
<p>It takes away the pain of transferring files on usb.</p>
<p>One can even collaboratively write books and articles ,brainstorm ideas using these tools.</p>
<p>The only thing is that a stable internet is necessary as these are mostly cloud based .</p>
<p><a href="https://gsuite.google.com/">Gsuite</a></p>
<h3 id="official-docsstackoverflowyoutuberedditgoogle">Official Docs,StackOverflow,YouTube,Reddit,Google</h3>
<p>The official Guides may have a lot of resources , but a beginner might find it difficult to find out how to use it.</p>
<p>Stackoverflow and Youtube tutorials to the rescue !! the support , solutions and videos on these platforms can be used to develop a quick prototype !!</p>
<p>These tools are like your personal Genie , Error in your code ,Just paste the error to get a solution :&gt;</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></p>

<h2 id="bat-blockchain-iot-ai">BAT - Blockchain , IOT , AI</h2>
<p>In most of the hacks if the teams have implemented a solution with these technologies and if they actually make sense then it can surely secure them a spot in the top 5 hacks.</p>
<p>Lets consider a scenario of  a problem statement related to Farming</p>
<p>We can easily use these technologies as shown below</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>IOT-Sensors send the data to the cloud where the plant health can be monitored</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI / Machine Learning- Analyse the data and build models to predict , and improve the efficiency of the crop growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blockchain: Immutable ledger to record the data and land records !!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here you go you are in the top three teams for the most innovative idea :)</p>
<p>Your Hack will  look something like this !!</p>
<p><img alt="Homer" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/e43MD18f4wdZC/giphy.gif" /></p>
<h1 id="choosing-teammates">Choosing Teammates</h1>
<p><img alt="LOLXD" src="https://i.imgflip.com/2r5ucr.jpg" /></p>
<p>The best way to sail through a hack is to form a team a day before the event begins</p>
<p>Always have a backup team member in case someone bails</p>
<p>It is always good to have someone in the team who knows how to make really good ppts, and also people who can express the project with humour , basically find someone who knows their Memes.</p>
<p>The above point cannot be stressed enough because the  main judging criteria of a hack is usually how the presentation is done , just imagine the fate of the judges , they have to select the best team form a group of 300 odd people .</p>
<p>Humor and presentation skills , answering to the point will greatly help your team leave a good impression on the fatigued judges :)</p>
<p>Also have an app / web developer who can quickly prototype a webpage/app to demonstrate the workflow of your idea</p>
<h1 id="coming-to-the-most-important-part-about-a-hack">Coming to the most important part about a hack !!</h1>
<h3 id="never-quit-in-the-middle">Never quit in the middle</h3>
<p>It is understandable that a beginner who has never been or heard of a hackathon cannot come up with a fully working product / prototype in a single night ,</p>
<p>The best part of a hackathon is that you don't need to come up with a fully working solution !!</p>
<p>The judging criteria will have many parameters and most of the marks that distinguish a better solution is uniqueness of the idea  , method of implementation  , presentation and workflow .</p>
<p>It is totally understandable if you didn't finish what you intended to do  , but always make sure that you can present what you intended to do with confidence to the judges , work on your idea to such an extent that it is foolproof , use diagrams/charts/illustrations   to describe your workflow !!</p>
<p>And at the end after all the hard work even if you lose or feel disheartened do not give up ,</p>
<p><img alt="Research" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZIzN7YWNuTUYg/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>Take home the idea or hack and keep working on it , Upload it to git , Write an article or a blogpost about the idea .</p>
<p>Describe the difficulties faced and the solutions for the various problems faced, this will help future hackers on their journey as well !!</p>
<p>Finally you can also apply to different hacks with the same idea (if it is allowed) and hopefully <strong>Luck</strong> will strike you there !!</p>
